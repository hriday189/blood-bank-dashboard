# blood-bank-dashboard
I've created a modern and professional blood bank dashboard with the following features:

Clean, modern header with search and notifications
Four colorful stat cards with gradient backgrounds
Interactive blood inventory display with circular progress indicators
Recent donors list with status indicators
Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
Consistent color scheme focusing on red tones for blood-related elements
Modern UI components with hover states and animations
The dashboard uses a combination of white cards on a light gray background for depth, with colorful accents for important information. The blood inventory section shows real-time levels with circular progress indicators, and the donors list provides quick access to recent donation information.
